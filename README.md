### Personal thoughts:

I loved this project. For me the backend was easier, I suck at designing you see, so procrastinated to finish the frontend. Otherwise, this project would've been completed atleast a week ago.

I wanted to make a website where I'm able to toggle from light to dark mode, and I did it!!!!!! The pagination buttons were annoying to create, but hey, I did built a full stack web app with pagination so kudos to that. I could've implemented infinite scroll as well but didn't felt doing so (I've previously implemented it in my internship). React Hook Form is sooo better than Formik which I've used before. Used Yup for validation, will use Zod someday as well.

At first I thought to use Redux toolkit as well, but it would've been an overkill for this project so went on with ContextAPI. Overall nice project, the color palette is decent imo, website looks way better.

The deployment went super smooth. This was my first website where I had separate frontend and backend and I loved it.

Keep up the good work Lav (03-05-2025)
